# ML_biscuit_analysis

This was an assessment set in my "Special Topics in AI and Deep Learning" module. It involves applying machine learning techniques to analyse  data on how three different types of biscuit absorb tea.

Detailed instructions for the assessment are provided in "instructions.pdf", with an overview of the scenario and the aims of the project. 

The datasets to be analysed are in the "datasets" folder, while the main analysis is done in the \"dunking_analysis.ipynb\" Jupyter Notebook. \
The functions used throughout this notebook are imported from the "dunking_functions.py" script.

The environment required for the analysis can be created and activated using:

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate ai_assessment_2
```

My final report of the analysis as described in the instructions is given in "AI dunking assessment.pdf".
